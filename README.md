# A very zipped minimalized micro miniautocad :)
This was an exercise done in the pratical component of an exam when I was attending my CET at Universidade Fernando Pessoa.

The intent of is not only to show what was one of the first things I've done as a student with C#, but also to give a other students something that might be good to play a little bit or to use as a guide for something else.

I can't remember everything but I think the only part missing from this exercise is to make an house automatically (Button 1 "Draw"), which is not correctly generating due to the point placements. (I needed to calculate the edges correctly but the exam was of 30 minutes I think so...)

#Notes
For now there's no validations for inputs so you have to fill every input for the measures, but not for the "Espessura" which is thickness of the brush.

# How-to
1. Just fill in the inputs
2. Press the Draw {option}
3. Be ready to design high quality rooms for your house (not)
4. ...
5. Have fun!
